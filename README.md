<!-- How to Play Crystal Collectors:

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. 

There are four crystals to the right of the page. By clicking on a crystal of your choice, you will add a specific amount of points to Your Score. 

You win the game by matching Your Score to the random number, or Target Score. You lose the game if Your Score goes above the Target Score. 

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time a new game begins, the game will change the values of each crystal. -->
