    // Your Score amount increases by that amount

// player continues to click on crystal options until they get to target number

// if player matches the target number, their Win goes up by 1, and then new random target number is generated (repeat process above)

// if player goes over the target number, then Loss goes up by 1 and a new random target number is generated (repeat process above)
